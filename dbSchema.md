To grade hackathon entries based on coherence, we can define the following set of types:

// Hackathon Entry
export type HackathonEntry = {
  projectId: string;
  projectName: string;
  problemStatement: string;
  solutionDescription: string;
  implementationDescription: string;
  technologyStack: string[];
  teamMembers: TeamMember[];
  coherenceScore: number;
  evaluationRemarks: string;
}

// Team Member
type TeamMember = {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: string;
}

With these types, we can create a database schema to store the hackathon entries. The schema can have a collection/table for Hackathon Entries where each document/row represents an individual entry. Each document/row will contain fields/columns for the properties defined in the HackathonEntry type.

Example MongoDB schema:

// Hackathon Entries Collection
const hackathonEntries = [
  {
    projectId: "1",
    projectName: "Decentralized Health Monitoring",
    problemStatement: "Lack of access to real-time health monitoring in remote areas",
    solutionDescription: "A decentralized app that connects IoT devices to monitor health data",
    technologyStack: ["Blockchain", "IoT", "Cloud Computing"],
    teamMembers: [
      {
        name: "John Doe",
        email: "john.doe@example.com",
        role: "Developer"
      },
      {
        name: "Jane Smith",
        email: "jane.smith@example.com",
        role: "Designer"
      }
    ],
    coherenceScore: 85,
    evaluationRemarks: "Good problem statement, well-defined solution, impressive technology stack"
  },
  // Other entries...
]

With this schema, we can store and query hackathon entries, and perform coherence grading by assigning a coherence score and providing evaluation remarks for each entry.
